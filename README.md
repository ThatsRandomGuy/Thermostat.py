# Thermostat.py
How to run:
This project was created using a raspberry pi 4, a breadboard, several wires, leds, capacitors, a temperature sensor, and a small fan. While it may be difficult to replicate, the code still functions as it should if you were to re-create the model. See "thermostat.png" for a picture of the final design.
